# huffman
Huffman compression and Decompression in C. Works best on Linux

To compile just type "make" command on the terminal

To Compress use following command:
./huffman "Inputfilenam" "outputfilename"    //Note "Inputfilenam" will be the name of file you want to compress and "outputfilename" will be the name of compressed file that the program will produce


To Decompress use following command 
./huffman -d "Inputfilenam" "outputfilename"   //Note "Inputfilenam" will be the name of compressed file you want to decompress. This should only be a file compressed by this program. And "outputfilename" will be the name of decompressed file that the program will produce
